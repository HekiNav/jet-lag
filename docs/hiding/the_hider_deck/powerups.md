# Powerups

There are several different types of powerup cards you can draw from the hider deck. These cards can be played at any time and allow you to take a particular type of advantageous action a single time; once powerup cards have been used, they are discarded and leave your hand. You only need to inform the seekers that you are using a powerup if that powerup has some kind of direct effect on them that they need to know about. These are the powerups in the hider deck:

### Veto

The veto powerup can be played in response to any question instead of answering. The seekers are given no answer to their question, and are instead informed that you have used a veto. The question is still considered to have been asked, and therefore can only be asked again for its additional cost. Since you have not answered their question, however, you are given no reward and do not draw any cards from the hider deck. You may play a veto at any time during the response window after a question has been asked.

### Randomize

The randomize powerup can be played in response to any question instead of answering. After the seekers have been informed that you have used a randomize powerup, they must choose–at random, either using a random number generator or dice–a different unasked question from the same category *(e.g. a 10 mile radar might become a 50 mile radar.)* This question is then automatically asked instead, and you provide an answer as normal. The original question is **not** considered to have been asked, and can therefore be asked again for its original cost. If the randomize causes a question to be asked that returns a null answer, this is permitted (tough luck, though). You may play a randomize at any time during the response window after a question has been asked.

### Discard 1, draw 2 and Discard 2, draw 3

These powerups can be played at any time and allow you to dispose of some undesirable cards in your hand in exchange for new random draws. For example, if you play 'Discard 1, draw 2' you will discard one undesirable card from your hand, and draw and keep two new ones. Because the 'Discard 1, draw 2' card wil also leave your hand when you play it, you will end up with the same number of cards you started with. If you do not have enough extra cards to discard, these powerups cannot be played.

### Draw 1, expand maximum hand size by 1

This powerup can be played at any time and immediately does two things: firstly, it allows you to draw and keep 1 card from the top of the deck. Secondly, it expands your hand to hold one extra card for the rest of the round, meaning you can keep up to 7 cards at once (or 8 if two of these powerups have been played.)

### Duplicate

The duplicate powerup can be played as an exact copy of another card–curse, powerup, or time bonus–currently in your hand. Once played, the original card will remain in your hand and can still be played later. If a duplicate remains in your hand at the end of the round, it can be used as a copy of any time bonus in your hand, effectively doubling that bonus.

### Move

The move powerup, if played at the right moment, can be one of the most powerful cards in the game. When played, you are granted a certain amount of time based on game size to establish a **new hiding zone**. The rules for finding a new hiding zone apply as usual; you must center yourself on a new transit station, and you can only use valid transit to reach your new location. While you move, your hiding timer is paused, and the seekers must stay where they are and refrain from asking questions until the move timer is up. At this point, the game resumes, and your hiding timer continues from where it was at the moment you played the move powerup. It is crucial to do this at the perfect moment, as playing the move comes at a severe cost–you must immediately **discard your entire hand and inform the seekers of your original transit station after playing it**. Given that the move cannot be played during the end game, this means that you must be confident that the seekers are close to finding you, *and* that you are better off starting from scratch instead of using the cards you've already accumulated over the course of your round. Play it wisely!
