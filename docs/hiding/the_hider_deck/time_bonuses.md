# Time Bonuses

Time bonus cards come in varying values and count towards the hider's final hiding time. These cards cannot be "played," and the only way that they leave the hider's hand is if they are discarded. Time bonuses are added to the hider's final hiding time **only if they are in the hider's hand at the end of the round**; discarding a time bonus means that it will no longer count towards your final hiding time. You should aim to hold as many time bonuses at the end of a round as possible. Time bonuses automatically scale based on your game size, so three values are listed on each card. Make sure you're using the right one for your game size!
