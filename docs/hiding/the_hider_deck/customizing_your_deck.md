# Customizing Your Deck

We've provided you with a default hider deck that should most likely work out of the box without any adjustments. We do, however, encourage you to tinker with the deck and have provided some blank cards to help you customize it if you wish. 

The hider deck includes a set of curse cards that we believe are well-balanced and should be doable in *most* conditions, but it is entirely possible that there are curses that are **not possible** or at least not feasible given the scope or area of your game. There are also curses that may require spending small amounts of money–or are otherwise undesirable for the vibe that you are trying to cultivate–that you may want to take out of the deck. If you decide to remove any curses, we'd encourage you to use the blank cards to write some custom curses of your own to replace them. Generally, we reccomend that your deck be about **50% time bonus cards, 25% powerup cards, and 25% curses**, but these ratios can be adjusted up or down depending on how much agency you want to give the hider.
