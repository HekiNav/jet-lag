# The Hider Deck

The hider deck is your one and only weapon to use against the seekers, so you'll have to use it wisely.

Every time the seekers ask a question, you will get to draw and keep a certain number of cards from the hider deck *(e.g. measuring questions allow you to draw 3 and keep 1–this means that you look at the top 3 cards of the deck, put 1 in your hand, and discard the other 2.)* You can keep up to 6 cards in your hand at one time (or more, if you draw the right powerup); if, at any point, your hand is full and you must draw another card, you must immediately play or discard cards until only 6 remain.

Cards drawn from the hider deck can provide you will all sorts of advantages–some in response to questions, some at the end of your round, and some whenever you think they make the most sense. In total, there are three different types of cards you can draw from the hider deck: Time Bonuses, Powerups, and Curses.
