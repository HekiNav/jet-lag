# Setting Map Borders

After you've determined the edges of your transit system, you'll need to establish a set of definitive borders for your game's map. As we've mentioned, the scale of your map is entirely up to you–whether it spans your country or continent–**but it is crucial that all players are using the exact same set of borders**. In some cases, these borders can be naturally emergent and easily standardized; a game that spans a single country, for example, can simply be contained to the borders of that country. For smaller scale games–like those that take place in a single city or metro area–natural borders might be more ill-defined. (How big is Atlanta? No one knows!) In these cases, we would recommend setting your own hard borders using a tool like _Google My Maps_. Generally, it's best to draw a square or circle that encompasses the totality of the transit system you plan on using for your game.

It's also extremely important to **ensure all players feel safe going to all areas of the map**. Players should discuss safety beforehand, and if there are any areas where players would not feel comfortable going, they should be excluded from the map.
