# Considering Rest Periods

If your game is large enough to potentially span multiple days, you will also need to set rest periods for each day. For the sake of fairness, we recommend doing this ahead of time. These can be as long as you'd like, so long as all players reset to their exact positions when the game resumes. We'd recommend a minimum of 10 hours, in order for all players to get sufficient rest.
