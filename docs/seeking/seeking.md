# Seeking

As the seeker, it is your job to move and gather information as efficiently as possible. At your disposal are 80 questions, which you can ask the hider at any time. The hider must answer all of your questions truthfully, but in exchange for answers, they'll be rewarded with cards from their hider deck. Choosing the right questions at the right time is the key to a quick round–ask too many questions and you'll be bogged down with curses or blown out with hours of time bonuses.

To make sorting through these questions easier, **we've divided them into six simple categories**. All of the questions in the same category cost the same number of cards, and share the same sentence structure–it's simply a matter of choosing a noun or value. Some categories are more useful during different stages of your search, so be sure to keep an open mind and change up your strategy as you close in on the hider.

You cannot ask multiple questions at once; if you are waiting on an answer from a previous question, you cannot ask your next question until the first has been answered.

You can use the internet for research, but **you cannot use Google Street View**. We have found Street View to be far too powerful when it comes to matching photos, and it makes the game generally less fun. This is our only strict rule about research, though you can choose to implement other rules if your group deems them necessary, such as an additional ban on searching for _any_ images of train stations.

As you collect information, you should record it in your investigation book and on a printout of your game map. There are many types of information you can collect in a given round–photos, directions, and context clues–and you'll want to stay on top of everything if you want any chance at finding your hider.
