# Playing With Cars (Or On Foot)

It is not lost on us that your hometown may not have sufficient public transit to play even the smallest version of _Hide and Seek_. Of course, there's always the possibility of

playing when you're out of town, but you may still be determined to make it work with cars and feet. In this case, you'll have to make a few modifications to the game's traditional ruleset:

**Setting your map:** Without a transit system, setting your map will become a matter of simply setting map borders. Make sure that these are drawn carefully, as it'll be even easier to confuse what is or isn't a valid hiding spot without a transit system.

**Hiding zones:** Hiding zones will still be drawn as a circle with a radius of varying size, depending on game size, somewhere on the map. Instead of being achored to a transit station, you should choose a **street terminus** to act as the center of your zone–that means the point at which one street ends, either at an intersection with another street, or a dead end. This street terminus should serve the same role as your transit station; photos that would normally be taken at a transit station would be taken there, questions referencing transit station names would reference that street's name, etc.

**Questions:** Most questions will still work as intended. Ignore any questions that reference transit frequency. As mentioned, some questions that reference the hider's transit station will reference their street terminus instead.

**Curses:** Any curse that cannot be played while the seekers are on transit should not be played when the seekers are in a moving car. Curses that prevent the seekers from taking "transportation" or "transit"–or impede them from doing something in transit–include cars.
