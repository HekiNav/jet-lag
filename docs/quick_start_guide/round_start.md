# Round Start

At the start of each round, one player/team will become the hider, while the remaining players will band together to play as the round's seekers. The order in which each player hides should be determined, at random, before the game begins.

While all players are still at the starting location–which can be anywhere within the game map–there are a few items to be distributed. The hider recieves the **hider deck**, and the seekers take the **investigation book**. We also recommend each side takes a **rulebook** to reference in case there is need for clarification or if any rule discrepancies arise. Optionally, the seekers might also choose to print out a map of their game area so that they can mark it as they play, and carry writing implements to take notes. Both sides should also keep at least **two dice** on them at all times, as these are used for various different things throughout the game.

Each round begins with a **hiding period**. During this time, the hider can use their legs and public transit to travel to any transit station within the map's boundaries. Once the hiding period has concluded, the hider must stay within their hiding zone for the rest of the round. The hiding period is determined by the game size:

import SizeLevels from '@site/src/components/SizeLevels';

<SizeLevels
leftTitle="Game Size"
rightTitle="Hiding Period"
align="right"
small={`30 minutes`}
medium={`60 minutes`}
large={`180 minutes`}
/>

Lastly, all seekers should make sure to turn on some form of tracker during this period to ensure the hider can follow their movements throughout the round. You can use real GPS trackers if happen to have them, but the easiest option for most people is to download one of the many free smartphone apps that allow other phones to track your phone's location. (We use Apple's "Find My" app, but Google Maps also allows for live location sharing if any players are using Android phones.)
