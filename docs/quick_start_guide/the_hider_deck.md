# The Hider Deck

The hider deck contains three types of cards that the hider can use to their advantage: **time bonus cards, powerup cards, and curse cards**. Cards are drawn after a question is answered, and kept in the hider's hand until they are played or discarded in the discard pile. **The hider can keep 6 cards in their hand at a time** (unless their hand size has been expanded through a powerup.) If, at any point, the hider has exceeded their hand limit, they must immediately play or discard cards until they only have 6 cards remaining. (For more information on the hider deck, visit [The Hider Deck](../hiding/the_hider_deck))
