# Asking Questions

In order to gather information about the hider's location, the seekers will have to ask questions from the **investigation book**. These questions can be asked at any time, as long as the previous question has been answered, and must be answered truthfully by the hider within 5 minutes, with the exception of photo questions, which must be answered within 10 minutes in small and medium games, and 20 minutes in large games. We ask hiders to make a good faith effort to answer all questions in the allotted time. However, if questions are not answered in the allowed time window, the hider's time is paused until the question is answered, and the hider will recieve no cards in exchange for answering.

After a question has been answered, the hider may draw and keep a certain number of cards from the **hider deck**, indicated in the **investigation book**, depending on the category of question asked. (For more information on asking questions, visit [Seeking](../seeking))

Once a question has been asked, it cannot be asked again unless the seekers choose to **pay its cost twice**. So, for example, a question that would typically allow a hider to draw 3 cards and keep 1 would now allow a hider to draw 3, keep 1, then draw 3, and keep 1 again (importanty: hiders cannot draw 6 and keep 2, they must draw 3 and pull 1 two seperate times, in this example.) Should seekers want to ask a question a third time, its cost would be triple; a fourth time, the cost quadrupled, and so on.

As you gather information about the hider's locatiom, you can use the internet for research to develop your theories. **The only prohibited source for information is Google Street View**; everything else is fair game.
