# Choosing Game Size

_Hide and Seek_ is configured to be played at three different scales: **small, medium, or large**. These sizes have slightly different rules designed to work best with your map's size and complexity. Before you do any further setup, you'll need to determine whether you'd like to play a small, medium, or large game of _Hide and Seek_.

import SizeLevels from '@site/src/components/SizeLevels';

<SizeLevels
small={`Spans a single town, small city, or portion of a large city; lasts 4–8 hours\n*Examples: Lower Manhattan; Winston-Salem, NC*`}
medium={`Spans a major city, metro area, or region; lasts about 1 day\n*Examples: Hong Kong; New York City; Greater London, UK*`}
large={`Spans a large region, an entire country, or several small countries; lasts 2 to 4 days\n*Examples: Switzerland; Japan; New England, US*`} align='left'
/>

The other major decision that will need to be made concerning game length is whether you want to add **additional rounds**. In the simplest configuration of the game, each player/team hides a single time–once everyone has had a chance to hide, the longest hiding time wins. **We consider hiding once per player to be the default version of the game,** and it's what we reccomend unless you are willing to commit significantly more time to playing. If you do chose to add additional rounds, hiding time is not counted cumulatively–it is only a player's best round that counts.
